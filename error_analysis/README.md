## Error analysis

### *error_analysis.ipynb*
This notebook contains the code used to sample all the abstracts of round 1 and round 2. We make use of the jupyter integration of the displacy visualizer to visualize our annotations. This visualizer does not work on GitHub. For proper visualization, run the notebook locally.

### Round 1
Round 1 contains png files of all the 10 sampled abstracts of round 1 annotated with the output of the model. The evaluation by hand annotated with the types of errors can be found in the *round1_annotations.pdf* file. The individual results for each abstract can be found in *round1_results.txt* and the combined results in *results_r1.xlsx*.

### Round 2
Round 2 contains png files of all the 12 sampled abstracts of round 2 annotated with the output of the model. The evaluation by hand annotated with the types of errors can be found in the *round2_annotations.pdf* file. The individual results for each abstract can be found in *round2_results.txt* and the aggregated results and the evaluation metrics for each individual abstract can be found on *results_r2.xlsx*.
